Q: I just need to send one text notification, on a weekly or monthly time period,
   to all the users of the app, ensuring all users will be notified, even if not using the app.
   I don't care about feedback

A (Claude):
For your specific needs - sending a single text notification periodically to all users, even when they're not actively using the app - you can implement a relatively simple solution without Firebase.
Here are three approaches you could consider:

 1. Service Worker: you'll need to implement a service worker in your PWA.
This will allow your app to receive push notifications even when it's not actively running.
 2. Web Push API: use the Web Push API to handle the notifications. This is built into modern browsers and doesn't require external services.
 3. Server-side scheduling: set up a simple server (if you don't already have one) to handle the periodic sending of notifications.

Here's a basic implementation outline for approach 1, Web Push API:

A. Set up the service worker (see service-worker.js)

B. Register the service worker and subscribe to push notifications (see in-app-register.js)

C. Server-side implementation:
    On your server, you'll need to:
    - Store user subscriptions
    - Set up a scheduled task to send notifications (weekly or monthly)
    - Implement the push notification sending logic (see server-side-push-notification-logic.js)


This solution allows you to send periodic notifications to all users without relying on Firebase.
It uses standard web technologies and a simple server setup.

Key points:
 1. Users need to grant permission for notifications when they first visit your app.
 2. The server stores subscription information for each user.
 3. A scheduled task on the server sends the notification to all subscribed users at the specified interval.

Remember to handle error cases, such as failed deliveries or expired subscriptions, in a production environment.
Also, consider using a database to store subscriptions persistently.
